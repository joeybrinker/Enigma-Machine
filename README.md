# Self Evaluation

### Object Oriented Programming
I feel like I did very well using classes and inheritance in this project. I would give myself a 5/5 on this part

### Initial Settings
I made it easy for the user to set up the 3 rotors, 3 positions, and 10 plugboard pairs by inputting their choices. This was very hard for me to figure out but I eventually made a parse function and a try statement to get around the error input and problems I was originally having. I would give myself a 5/5.

### Unit Tests
These were confusing to me in the beginning but after re-watching the lecture I think I got the hang of it. I tested every function in each class therefore they all work as intended so I'm not too sure what else needs to be tested. I feel like there is room for improvement and I may have missed something due to this being new to me. As the options are either 10 or 0 points on the rubric, I feel like my tests do not deserve 0 points. So I would give myself a 10/10.
